GoLang Notes


Identifiers 
user defined names{in programming languages}
In Go language, an identifier can be a variable name, function name, constant, statement labels, package name, or types.

For example in this code

package main

import ( 
     “fmt”

)


func  main() {

var name = “MohitisNerd”


}


The above program has 3 identifiers
1. main : package 
2. main : function
3. name : name of the variable



There are certain rules for defining a variable if these rules are not followed we can get a compilation-time error.

Do’s  
must begin with either a underscore(_) or a letter
must be a-z or A-Z or 0-9 and as we  know ‘_’
its case sensitive.
should be between 4-15  

Don’t
must not start with a  digit 
keywords are not allowed to be used as a identifier.

Uniqueness of the identifier 

The identifier represented by _(underscore ) is known as blank identifier.
Which can be used as anonymus placeholder



Keywords in GoLang


there are some reserverd word which cannot be used as a identifier as these are used in some internal process or they represent some predefined actions.

Using them could result in compile-time error
